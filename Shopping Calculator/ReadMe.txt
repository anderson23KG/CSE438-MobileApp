The purpose for this project was to create a shopping calculator.  In addition to being in Spanish, my calculator has the added feature of an imaginary shopping list.

In more detail this feature allows the user to include a calculated final price into their "shopping list" by clicking the button located below the final price. In doing so the user can acquire the total amount for everything in their shopping list. This amount is displayed under the label "Total de mi lista de compras". Once the user is done with a particular list of prices they can clear the list by clicking the button located at the bottom with the label "limpiar mi lista".

To implement this feature correctly I made sure no incorrect prices were added to the shopping list. Thus a final price could only be calculated if all categories (original price, discount, and sales tax) were filled correctly. To let the user know that things still needed to be filled out the final price text would display the "error" message. Additionally, to let the user know what needed to be filled out, 3 additional labels were added at the bottom of all categories and each label will fade out once the user has filled the category with an appropriate value. The shopping list was then finalized using buttons and creating target action functions for when the buttons were clicked.

I chose to implement this because I find it stressful not knowing how much I am spending at the grocery store until right when I am at the paying counter. Therefore this feature would allow you to calculated the price of each item at the grocery store(or any store) and add it to your shopping cart. Once added to your shopping cart you would be able to know how much you will be spending with all the items in your cart. This could be great when shopping with a budget leaving you worried free when you are at the paying counter.
