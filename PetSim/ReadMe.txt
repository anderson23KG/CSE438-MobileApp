The purpose for this project was to create a was to create a pet simulation app. In addition to fulfilling all the required functionalities provided in the handout, I added sound to this application.

1) The sound effect for each animal was added. The sound only plays when the play button is pushed and the food level is at 0. This was implemented as a way to let the user know the animal was hungry. Once the animal is feed and the play button is pushed once more the sound will no longer play. This is to signify a happy fed animals. Due to time constraints, I was unable to find a short sound video for the bunny thus the sound will continue longer than all the other pet sounds. Additionally, I am still learning how to add sounds on Xcode thus the volume of the sound may vary. This is especially true for the bunny sound as it can be hard to hear.

2) The sound effect was done using the AVFoundation provided by apple. This allowed me to easily access method that allows for audio playback. The core work done to implement this feature can be found in the playMusic() function in swift control. The function also provides a link to the resource utilization to correctly implement audio playing. In the function, a URL is created for an audio player object to read in and play. To make sure the audio-only played when the pet was hungry a bool variable called "hungry" was added to the pet class. This variable was only set to "true" when an object of the class was initialized or when the food level reached 0. This variable was used to determine if the audio needed to be played using if statements. Additionally, the URL variable for the song was updated every-time a pet button was clicked. This allowed for the correct sound to play.

3) I implemented this feature thinking that animals usually are very vocal when something is bothering them. Therefore I wanted to make the pet app more realistic by making sure each pet vocalized whenever they were hungry and thus unhappy.
