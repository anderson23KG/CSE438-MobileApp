The purpose for this project was to create a movie searching app utilizing the movie database API:
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

This app made use of API calls to populate a collection view for movies the user woulds search for. 
Once the result had been obtains the user had the option to click on each of the results displayed and see more information about the movie. They also had the options to look at trailers if any were available. The user could then add movies to a list of favorites to keep a record of movies they would be interested in watching. 

In addition to allowing the user to reach for a specific movie the app allowed the user to look at popular searches such as favorites based on genre etc.
