The purpose for this project to simulate a finger sketch app with added features: erasing and highlighting. 

The erase feature works by clicking on the erase button. Once being clicked the user can touch and drag on the drawing canvas and erase any lines created on that spot. To switch out of erase mode the user simply needs to click any of the color options provide on the bottom of the screen. The other feature added is the highlighter option. With this option the person can highlight any of the lines drawn on the canvas. The color of the highlighter is set to yellow and can not be changed. Line the erase button the user can switch out of highlighter mode by simply clicking on any of the color options provided below.

The eraser mode was created by simply changing the color of the path to the background color through a target action function. As for the highlighter a few things were done to implement. First a highlighter component was added to the Line struct and to the view controller class. This component was a bool variable that determined if the line drawn should follow a highlighter aspect of not. Additionally the draw function in Line View was modified allowing it to draw the curve differently if the highlighter mode was on. Finally the value of the bool highlighter variable changed through target action functions. 

I implemented these two features for the following reasons. While the app already contained features that allowed it to clear and undo lines on the drawing canvas  the user did not have the option to select what needed to be deleted. This feature is important for the user since it allows them to make mistake while doing a sketch and still being to delete a small portion of the drawing as oppose to complete lines or the complete canvas. As for the highlighter feature it essential to be able to emphasize important components on your drawing canvas specially if your are writing notes.
